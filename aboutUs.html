                            An About Us page exists to share a business story and history and provide a deeper
                            connection
                            with customers.
                            <br>

                            Consumers want to know the team behind the brand they are supporting. An About Us page
                            provides
                            the perfect real estate to pull back the curtain and reveal who is working behind the
                            scenes.
                            <br>

                            Most importantly, though, an About Us page facilitates trust between the consumer and the
                            business. <br>

                            More than 33% of consumers say that “trust” is a core factor when deciding which businesses
                            to
                            support. <br>

                            With an About Us page, you can begin to form an emotional relationship with customers and
                            engage
                            with them on a deeper level. <br>

                            So how can you create one that resonates? Lets look at some of the components you need to
                            include in your About Us page. <br>
